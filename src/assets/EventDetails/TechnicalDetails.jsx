      eventLongDetails: `Welcome to the Glider Design Competition! This event is designed to challenge participants to create the most innovative and aerodynamic gliders using only cardboard, paper, and charts. The competition will be judged on design creativity, flight performance, and overall aesthetic appeal.`,
      eventMode: `Offline`,
      rules: ` Participants must be present in teams of three.

      1. Participants must design their gliders using only cardboard, paper, and charts etc.(Metals like coins,nails, etc are strictly not  allowed due to safety aspects).

      2. No wheels are allowed on the glider. It must slide to a halt on the ground, not roll to a stop.
      
      3. The glider body may not consist of folded paper (no large paper airplanes are allowed).
      
      4. The glider must have a minimum wingspan of 2 feet (24 inches). This will be measured from wingtip to wingtip with a tape measure.
      
      5. The glider body must be no more than 4 inches wide and no more than 4 inches high. This is for the body only and does not include the wingspan or the tail surfaces. There is no restriction on the overall length of the glider.
      
      6. Ballistic entries are not allowed. In other words, you cannot toss it like a shot put.
      
      7. Gliders must be entirely handcrafted. No machines or 3D printers may be used in the construction of the gliders.
      
      8. Gliders must be able to fly on their own without any additional assistance.
      
      9. Each participant may only submit one glider for judging.
      
      10. Participants are not allowed to make any adjustments to their gliders once they have been submitted for judging.
      
      11. Any inappropriate or offensive designs will be disqualified from the competition.
      
      12. All participants must adhere to safety guidelines during the competition.`,
